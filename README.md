# Prediction-and-improvement-of-Contract-Renewals
Constructed a logit probability model in python to predict the contract renewals based on past service incident data using exponential time decay, correlation with multiplicative impact from the number of cases and escalations, determined maximum likelihood using optimize function in SciPy. Gathered the complete contract information by joining different datasets, pre-processed and cleaned the customer comments by analysing text using regular expressions, topic modelling with LDA to improve prediction accuracies. The final model was able to increase the contract renewals by 8%.
